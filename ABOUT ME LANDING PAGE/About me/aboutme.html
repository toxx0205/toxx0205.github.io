   <blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Timothy Jan E. Daria.<sup>1</sup> I was born on February 05, 2001, 
   at President Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Hospital Iba, Zambales.<sup>2</sup> We live in Botolan, Zambales up until now.<sup>3</sup> I 
   live there with my parents and my older brother.<sup>4</sup> Growing up, I had a lovely family.<sup>5</sup> I had an older brother 
   that used to play with me.<sup>6</sup> I remember every weekend morning we always watch the morning cartoon and anime show on GMA.<sup>7</sup> 
   But every weekday I am just alone playing with my toys and watching television because my brother is at school. When I turn 3 my parents send me
   to a pre-school and in there I find new friends and new playmates.<sup>8</sup> I also remember that I celebrate my 4th birthday at my school. 
   I also had my first field trip to that school, we went to Zoo, Amusement park, and I also remember that we went to the studio of Eat Bulaga and
   we had so much fun at the studio.<sup>9</sup> For my Kindergarten, my parents decided to move me to another school which is where my brother is.
   <sup>10</sup> So for my Kindergarten, I moved to St. Augustine School Iba, Zambales.<sup>11</sup> I found many new friends that are still my friends 
   up until now and I remember one of my memorable experiences as a kindergarten is when we practiced our play for our moving up.<sup>12</sup> I had
   so much fun doing it and with that, I found my talent. Every summer vacation I play outside with my neighbor.<sup>13</sup> I play with them every street
   game like <i><q>Tumbang preso, piko, agawan base, etc...</q> </i>and when the kite is a trend back then we always play kite in the field of grass near our house
   and we compete with each other on who’s kite will last longer in the air, of course, I always win.<sup>14</sup> We also go to irrigation to go swim.
   <sup>15</sup> It was clean before so we always go to play there.<sup>16</sup> I remember that I had a little accident when we went there because I slid
   when we were climbing back at the top.<sup>17</sup> After all, it is slippery so I got home with a scratch on my nose because my face slipped. 
   <sup>18</sup> Then Elementary school comes.<sup>19</sup> I am still in my school from kindergarten.<sup>20</sup> I found new friends and good
   memories from my elementary school days.<sup>21</sup> Every recess I play together with my friends and classmates.<sup>22</sup> Even in lunch we
   play after we eat. That's why sometimes I go home in a dirty uniform.<sup>23</sup> I spent my elementary school days in that school and I feel 
   that I spent not only my elementary days there but also my childhood.<sup>24</sup><br>

   <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
   <hr size="5" color="Black" width="12%" align ="center"><br>
   <blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13 is where I became a teen and at that time I am a Junior High School student.<sup>1</sup> 
   I am still in the same school from my Elementary.<sup>2</sup> When I enter Junior high school it was
   very hard for me to adjust.<sup>3</sup> Nothing changed from me as I hit my teenage years but I discovered new 
   and it was K-pop I became a fan of two groups, 2NE1 and BigBang.<sup>4</sup> I also got to have new friends because 
   of that, we all stream music video and sometimes we learn the dance together.<sup>5</sup> But before I am also a secret
   K-pop fan because back then If you are a K-pop fan they will discriminate you so sometimes I deny that I am a fan.<sup>6</sup>
   I overcome it and now I am still a fan.<sup>7</sup> Also on my teenage years I discovered that I can make people laugh with my 
   jokes.<sup>8</sup> When I was in grade 8 my section made a page for memes and I always make an entry and they say that my memes are
   funny so I make many memes.<sup>9</sup> But I make sure that I have their consents.<sup>10</sup> In this year I found out that I am an 
   introvert but I am also noisy in the classroom.<sup>11</sup> I am always called by my teacher because I am noisy in the room but when I am
   with my family I am quiet at home.<sup>12</sup> I learned that year also on how to gossip, still I did not make it a habit because it is bad. <sup>13</sup> 
   When I was just in the house I didn’t do much because I don’t really like to go outside in that year.<sup>14</sup> I will just go out if I have errands 
   to do or project to do. <sup>15</sup> This year I also developed my competitiveness because of intramural sports as we compete
   with higher grades.<sup>16</sup> In 2017 I got addicted to Korean drama as much as I was addicted to K-pop before.<sup>17</sup> I also 
   discovered carinderia that year and it helped me to save money. <sup>18</sup> After Junior High School I got moved up to Senior High School
   and I am still loyal in that school actually I got a loyalty award on moving up.<sup>19</sup> Since this program is new to me I need to adjust 
   again.<sup>20</sup> I got new friends and not just friends but I think them as my siblings.<sup>21</sup> Even though I have a bad moment or something
   happens at home that gives me a bad mood every time I go to school It lifts my bad mood to a good mood because of my friends.<sup>22</sup> Teenage is
   really one of the best years of my life and if I have a chance to be back at that time I will not hesitate to go back.<sup>23</sup><br>

   <h2>College Years</h2>
   <hr size="5" color="Black" width="12%" align ="center"><br>
   <blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2019 when I entered University of the East but it is not my dream school 
   I am just having no choice because the only admission exam I took was UE so now here I am. <sup>1</sup> I am an IT student and currently 
   in 2<sup>nd</sup> semester of 2<sup>nd</sup> year.<sup>2</sup> I am very nervous on my first day because I will be in a new environment.<sup>3</sup> 
   Because from kindergarten to senior High I go to one school.<sup>4</sup> I heard many rumours about being in college that it is hard and you will not 
   sleep and I think the rumours are right.<sup>5</sup> Actually IT  is not my first choice course. I actually want to pursue culinary but It comes to my 
   mind that I can take it anytime then I decided to take another course which is IT and I thought there is no math in the course so I got scammed.<sup>6</sup>
   But now here I am.<sup>7</sup> I survived the first year. <sup>8</sup> Currently surviving my 2<sup>nd</sup> year.<sup>9</sup> Back to the first year days
   as a shy person I had a hard time finding new friends because I don’t really know how to approach people.<sup>10</sup> Thankfully I have now my friends and 
   I am very thankful for having them.<sup>11</sup> When I am commuting I am always shock on how many commuter in Manila and here in manila I am always nervous
   when commuting because on what I heard from news.<sup>12</sup> Thank God I am always safe and I got home complete.<sup>13</sup> My most favorite part of my 
   college life is the gastam bide because of the food there specially the corndog and taro in trinas and of course the sinigang na 
   lechon in gavins.<sup>14</sup> I Learned how to play billiard there but I did not make a habit.<sup>15</sup> When I was in manila 
   I think I enjoyed going out not like when I was in high school.<sup>16</sup> But now here I am stock again in the house and I am
   back being lazy to go out from the house.<sup>17</sup> This not what I imagine my college life was.<sup>18</sup> Being stock in
   the house and interact with people thru screen and not in personal.<sup>19</sup> That is what I am missing right now I really want
   to experience all of that again hopefully that this pandemic will be over so that we can go back to our normal life.<sup>20</sup>
