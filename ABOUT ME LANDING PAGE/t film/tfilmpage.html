   new girl in school, welcoming her into a clique nicknamed “Sunny.”

But one day while visiting her mother at the hospital she encounters Chun Hwa, who is now terminally ill. As the
 two renew their relationship and reminisce, Chun Hwa implores Na Mi to bring the scattered group together one
 last time.

 friends discover they can still change one another’s lives…
